<h1>Welcome to my webpage!!!</h1>
  Here I will be posting information about myself as described in the class grading rubric.
<p> My name is Wynn Hartson and live in Hawaii!  One of my hobbies is 3D prinitng.  You can find a lot of STL files for free use on the thingiverse website, located here:
  <a href="https://thingiverse.com">thingiverse.com</a><br>Sometimes when 3D printing, things can go <em>bad</em> if the printer is left unattended, 
  as seen in this picture of a recent print failure that I had:<a href="3D Printer.jpg">link</a>
  <br>So when that happens, I like to shift my focus to another one of my hobbies, which is woodworking!</p>
<p>I have been interested in woodworking since I took a shop clas in my junior year of high school.  
  One of my favorite woodworkers on youtube is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3EpWncNq5QL0QhwUNQb7w">Paul Sellers.</a>
