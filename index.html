<h1>Welcome to my webpage!!!</h1>
  Here I will be posting information about myself as described in the class grading rubric.
<p> My name is Wynn Hartson and live in Hawaii!  One of my hobbies is 3D prinitng.  You can find a lot of STL files for free use on the thingiverse website, located here:
  <a href="https://thingiverse.com">thingiverse.com</a><br>Sometimes when 3D printing, things can go <em>bad</em> if the printer is left unattended, 
  as seen in this picture of a recent print failure that I had:<img src="3D Printer.jpg" alt="failed three dee print" width="120" height="160">
  <br>So when that happens, I like to shift my focus to another one of my hobbies, which is woodworking!</p>
<p>I have been interested in woodworking since I took a shop clas in my junior year of high school.  
  One of my favorite woodworkers on youtube is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3EpWncNq5QL0QhwUNQb7w">Paul Sellers.</a> I can really relate to his love of hand tools.
  I recently made this for a colleuge that changed duty stations after watching a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hP-QAAhpxQ&t=2s">Matt Estleas</a> channel.</p>

<p>Another hobby of mine is exploring this wonderful island of Oahu that I live on!  and what a better way to do that than in this beautiful orange truck that I have!
